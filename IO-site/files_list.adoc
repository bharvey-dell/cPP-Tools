== Templates Provided
In each repository for the iTC, there are several templates and files, each with its own purpose. This focuses on the template files and will describe their purpose.

Most of the templates are written in Asciidoctor syntax. You should take a look at the Templates_README.adoc file as it provides some direct information about general contents of the templates.

=== iTC Documentation Templates
These templates are more about the administration of the iTC and not the cPP being worked on. These focus on the core functionality of the iTC, things like voting, scheduling and the review/release process.

The iTC administrator should have used the template repositories during the setup of the GitHub workspaces, so these should be located in something like along the lines of an iTC-Admin repository.

The latest versions of these files can be found https://github.com/itc-wgtools/iTC-docs[here].
