# Introduction to cPP-Tools

As the number of iTCs grows, it has fallen on each iTC to figure out how to manage the process of creating and managing the process of creating the cPP and Supporting Documents. Even the processes for updates and technical decisions is new.

While there is no single "right way" to manage an iTC, the purpose of this repository is to produce a set of guidance and templates that can be used to help iTCs perform these tasks using the knowledge and experience of those that have come before. The respository will eventually provide guidance documents on how to use the recommended tools as well as templates for the documents. Further, the repository will also provide templates for iTC processes (such as managing the interpretation process) to assist in the smooth operations of an iTC.

In addition to information posted here, the [wiki](https://github.com/itc-wgtools/cPP-Tools/wiki) will be used for information (such as meeting notes) that doesn't fit directly into a respository.
